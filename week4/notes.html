	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>Just an image and title header didn't seem to me to be much of a page.  And the image, though it consists of lots of text within it, is just an image.  The page needed some actual text.  So here it is.</p>
	<p>First of all, I want to apologize for the quality of the image.  The only scanner I could find was in the CAS building, where my USB actually <em>broke</em> and I had to e-mail the images to myself which significanly limited the size and quality of the image.  I did the best I could to make the image bigger and delete some of the noise, but I'm still learning photoshop.</p>
    <p>As for the color, while I know it's not a perfectly <em>white</em> background, I wanted to preserve the color of the gel pen I used and incorporate it in the layout.  A lovely purple.</p>
