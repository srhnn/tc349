        <p>I wanted to organize the site into sections based on information about the moon, the latest news relating to the moon, and activites for the users to do.</p>
        <p>I will be honest, I was not sure what to do people, and partners and the random "niel armstrong" category.  I had no idea what it was.</p>
        <p>I figured there were two sections in activites for the users to do, one more based for entertainment, "media", and another for actual utility as well requiring participation.</p>
        <p>This differs from the main site which splits the page into many more categories, which I think is actually more organized now that I think about it.</p>

        <p>The NASA group actually sort of surprised me, but I liked the "get involved" and "strategic partners" grouping.  The Moon grouping was simplified to anything with "moon" in the name it seems.  The same rule also seemed to apply to the "missions" section.  It makes sense.  Keywords and all.  I found it interesting that images, videos, and twitter made it to the main links, but perhaps it is the media itself that these users are drawn to.</p>

	<h1>Card Sorting: Original Content: Kid Loki</h1>
    <section>
	<h2>About the Website</h2>
    	<p>As of late, I have been obsessing over the latest character in Marvel creation.  Kid Loki.  I say "latest" and "creation" not because Loki is a character newly invented- he has been around since 1965- rather, he has gone through a new transformation, not only in physical appearance, but in character!</p>
        <p>I want to create a site to help readers new to the marvel universe but interested in Kid Loki, having heard of him through whatever other means, to find a place to jump in and begin learning about him!  I want to give readers a chance for a list of what to read should they want to learn about this young Loki on their own, as well as give spoiler summaries to those who do not have access to the books but still wish to learn what happens.  I also want to provide more than just official information, but provide users with fan made content such as images, gifs, fan fiction, and fan art!</p>

            </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>I sorted through my layout as I would introducing Loki.  I wanted to begin with outright information about him, about his character, about his abilities, as well as give a reading list of where to start reading and learning about Loki.</p>
        <p>Then I provided the titles of the series in which he appears that are relevant to Kid Loki, where I wanted to summarize the events and Loki's meddling hands regarding the event.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I wanted to provide some images, writings, and other fan works available to the reader to enjoy relating to Kid Loki.  It will also help them find communities and others who love Kid Loki.</p>

        </table>
        <p>The other participants seemed to mostly agree with the way I had organized my site, however, fan work and fan art seem to put into another section due to the misconception that the other images and gifs are not fan created.  The reading order is also put away from the titles and about section, but I was told there was a lack of understanding in what exactly it was/meant.</p>
